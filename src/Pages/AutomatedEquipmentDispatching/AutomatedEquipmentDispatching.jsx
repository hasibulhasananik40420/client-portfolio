            My role was supporting the integration of an artificial intelligence feature that would nudge employees to pick up equipment sooner. I led Experience Mapping to spotlight where the new feature may not address issues connected to picking up equipment sooner. I also led Concept Testing, identifying employee concerns with the new feature, spotlighting confusing and requested add-on functionality, and highlighting training preferences. I also held a weekly meeting with Training to distribute feedback surveys and identify additional research needs.

            To help build greater awareness of current day challenges in picking up equipment, I also led A Day In The Life Panel Discussion with the employee group (i.e., Equipment Dispatchers) responsible for scheduling equipment pickups.This touchpoint allowed various Product Managers (e.g., e-commerce, sales & services) to understand where their products created downstreams issues during pickups.I also served as a reviewer of a narrative document highlighting Equipment Dispatchers' Day in The Life (both pre-release and post-release of the feature) and conducted benchmark experience testing (i.e., measuring ease of use & satisfaction) of the application receiving the new feature.

            My research elevated the urgency of an identified - but not yet scheduled - roadmap item connected to pick up delays.My findings also led to training format changes (e.g., including in-person, hands-on training) in support of rolling out the feature.

                Pickup delays occurred because missing job site information caused Equipment Dispatchers to send vehicles that couldn't pick up the equipment. Additionally, customers placing equipment in blocked locations and moving equipment to new job sites requiring additional planning and travel time further contributed to the delays.

                When integrating artificial intelligence features into employeeâ€™s work tools, Research partnering with Training is a good idea. This partnership creates multiple surveying opportunities to understand feature perception. One opportunity, for example, exists after conducting training, while another opportunity exists after a few weeks of using the feature.               </p>
