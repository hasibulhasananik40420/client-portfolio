            Completed equipment rentals regularly sat on customer's job sites several days before being picked-up and returned back to the rental's branch.

            My role was leading research in support of launching an artificial intelligence feature that would nudge employees to pick up equipment sooner. I led Experience Mapping to spotlight where the new feature may not address issues connected to returning equipment sooner. I also led Concept Testing to identify employee concerns with the automation feature, spotlight confusing and requested add-on features, and highlight training preferences. I also held a weekly meeting keeping Research, Operations and Training aligned on research needs and, where appropriate, quickly aligning on findings.

            To build greater awareness on current day challenges when picking up equipment, I led A Day in The Life Panel Discussion with the employee group (i.e. Equipment Dispatchers) responsible for scheduling equipment pickups. This touchpoint allowed various Product Managers (e.g. e-commerce, sales & services) to understand where their products created downstreams issues during pickups. I also served as a reviewer of a narrative document highlighting Equipment Dispatchers' Day in The Life (both pre-release and post-release of the feature). In addition, I supported an ease-of-use and satisfaction benchmark of the Equipment Dispatcher's application pre-release of the feature.

            My research elevated urgency of an identified - but not yet scheduled - roadmap item connected to pick up delays. My findings also led to training format changes (e.g. including in-person, hands-on training) in support of rolling out the feature.

                Equipment pickup delays were sometimes due to Drivers unknowingly bringing a truck that was unable to reach and/or load the equipment. Pickup delays were also connected to customers moving equipment to new locations that required long-distance travel.

                When integrating artificial intelligence features into employeeâ€™s work tools, Research partnering with Training is a good idea. This partnership creates multiple surveying opportunities to understand feature perception. One opportunity, for example, exists after conducting training, while another opportunity exists after a few weeks of using the feature.               </p>
